#summary The jQuery html5upload Plugin API provides a simple method that allows you to easily upload files.

= html5upload =

Uploads the form via AJAX. The most common use case of this method on the submission of a form that uploads 1 or more files. This method can also be used on an individual file input so that a file can be uploaded without having the submit the whole form.

== Parameters ==

=== options ===
`options` is an `object` containing 1 or more of the following fields:
  * `data`: `data` is an `object` containing key-value pairs of any additional fields to send along with the file upload.
  * `onAbort`: `onAbort` is a `callback` function that is called when the upload is aborted. The `callback` is passed the `event object` from the underlying `XMLHttpRequest object` in its first parameter.
  * `onError`: `onError` is a `callback` function that is called when an error occurs during the upload. The `callback` is passed the `event object` from the underlying `XMLHttpRequest object` in its first parameter.
  * `onLoad`: `onLoad` is a `callback` function that is called when the files are done being uploaded. The `callback` is passed the `event object` from the underlying `XMLHttpRequest object` in its first parameter, and the original `XMLHttpRequest object` in its second parameter.
  * `onProgress`: `onProgress` is a `callback` function  that is called multiple times during the progress of the upload. The `callback` is passed the `event object` in its first parameter.
  * `url`: `url` is the URL to upload to. If `url` is empty or not specified, then the request sent to the current page's URL.
  * `useFormData`: If `true`, all of the form's data fields will be sent along with the file upload; otherwise, the form's data fields will be ignored. This option is ignored if this method was called on a file input.
